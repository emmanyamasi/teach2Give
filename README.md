# FAQ ACCORDION USING HTML AND CSS

This project is a responsive FAQ card built with HTML, CSS, and  Inline JavaScript. It allows users to view frequently asked questions (FAQs) and toggle the answers by clicking on the questions.

## Features

- **Interactive FAQ Section**: Users can click on a question to reveal the answer and hide it again by clicking on another question.
- **Toggle Icon**: Each question has a "+" icon that changes to "-" when the answer is shown.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout is responsive and works on different screen sizes.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the FAQ card.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling (linked on html file).
- Inline JavaScript: Adds functionality to make the FAQ questions interactive.

## How It Works

1. The FAQ card is displayed with a list of questions and a toggle icon ("+").
2. When a user clicks a question:
   - The corresponding answer is shown.
   - The "+" icon changes to a "-" icon.
3. Clicking on another question automatically hides the previously open answer, ensuring only one answer is visible at a time.
